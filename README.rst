===========================================
An MBR partition reading / writing library.
===========================================

This is a Python library for reading and writing `MBR`_ partition data.

.. _MBR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record

.. note::
   This library isn't really tested at all. I wouldn't use it for any data you
   seriously care about.
